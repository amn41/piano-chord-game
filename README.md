# Simple Piano Chord Guessing Game

[Preview](https://653d4c0800a10f0008bdc709--harmonious-medovik-c901fa.netlify.app/)

Note the 'hear chord' button doesn't work on safari - browser must support web-audio.

Based on https://github.com/newlandsvalley/chord-editor


### TODO

- [ ] add support for all minor chords
- [ ] add support for all inversions (randomize)
- [ ] add seventh chords
- [ ] allow users to select which chord types to include
- [ ] find a better solution for quasi-randomness (at least ensure don't stay on same chord)


To build
